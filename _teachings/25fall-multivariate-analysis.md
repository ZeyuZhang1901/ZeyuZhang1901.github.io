## Course Description

The primary goal of this course is to present statistical methods for describing and analyzing multivariate data, data
in which the response is multidimensional. Topics covered will include principal component analysis, canonical
correlation, multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, and clustering. Although the statistical theory behind the
methods will be discussed, the course will emphasize the statistical and geometric motivation for the methods, the
practical application of the methods, and the interpretation of the results. Given the nature of the data, and the
methodology used, linear algebra plays an important role in the course. Thus, a second goal of the course is to
present topics in linear algebra that are useful in understanding statistical methodology.
