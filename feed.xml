My research focuses on knowledge leakage in large language models, with particular emphasis on settings that involve complex reasoning and chain-of-thought processes. I study how and when sensitive or unintended information may be exposed during multi-step inference, and I am interested in principled methods for detecting, characterizing, and mitigating such leakage. In parallel, I work on fine-tuning language models using reinforcement learning–based approaches, including RLHF, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and related algorithms, with the goal of improving alignment, robustness, and controllability. Outside of research, I am deeply committed to an active lifestyle. I follow a structured workout program and train almost every day, viewing physical discipline as a natural complement to intellectual rigor. I enjoy a wide range of sports, with basketball being my favorite, and I am particularly drawn to long-distance running for both its physical demands and its meditative rhythm. These activities keep me grounded, energized, and continuously motivated—both on and off the track. </subtitle><entry><title type="html">Generating High-Quality Paper Figures with Gemini</title><link href="https://zeyuzhang1901.github.io/blog/2026/generating-paper-figures-with-gemini/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Generating High-Quality Paper Figures with Gemini"/><published>2026-01-22T16:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2026-01-22T16:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://zeyuzhang1901.github.io/blog/2026/generating-paper-figures-with-gemini</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zeyuzhang1901.github.io/blog/2026/generating-paper-figures-with-gemini/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Creating high-quality figures for research papers—such as architecture diagrams, pipeline illustrations, and conceptual visualizations—is often time-consuming.
