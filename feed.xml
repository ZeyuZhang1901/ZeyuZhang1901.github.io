My research focuses on knowledge leakage in large language models, with particular emphasis on settings that involve complex reasoning and chain-of-thought processes. I study how and when sensitive or unintended information may be exposed during multi-step inference, and I am interested in principled methods for detecting, characterizing, and mitigating such leakage. In parallel, I work on fine-tuning language models using reinforcement learning–based approaches, including RLHF, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and related algorithms, with the goal of improving alignment, robustness, and controllability. Outside of research, I am deeply committed to an active lifestyle. I follow a structured workout program and train almost every day, viewing physical discipline as a natural complement to intellectual rigor. I enjoy a wide range of sports, with basketball being my favorite, and I am particularly drawn to long-distance running for both its physical demands and its meditative rhythm. These activities keep me grounded, energized, and continuously motivated—both on and off the track. </subtitle></feed>
