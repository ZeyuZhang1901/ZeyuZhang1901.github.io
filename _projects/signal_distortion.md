## Project Overview

**Institution:** University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)  
**Mentor:** Dr. Wei Lu  
**Duration:** April 2021 - November 2021

## Key Achievements

- Reduced distortion error to around **0.5%** with requirement of **3%** and extended measurement bandwidth to **1kHz-100kHz**
- Applied **window functions** to reduce Spectrum Leakage. Considering both effectiveness and feasibility, I chose Hanning window finally
- Designed an algorithm to **accurately detect the center spectrum** by adding energy from nearby spectrum lines
- Developed an LCD to visualize relevant data and input analog signals

## Technical Details

### Spectrum Leakage Reduction

The project focused on addressing distortion during sampling, specifically targeting spectrum leakage. By implementing Hanning window functions, we significantly improved measurement accuracy while maintaining practical feasibility.

### Center Spectrum Detection

A custom algorithm was developed to enhance spectrum detection accuracy by intelligently aggregating energy from nearby spectrum lines, ensuring precise identification of the center spectrum.

### User Interface

An LCD display was integrated to provide real-time visualization of measurement data and analog signal inputs, improving the device's usability and monitoring capabilities.
